        <h3>Why programming ?</h3>
        <p>In this digital age the knowledge of programming is essential in order to bring innovation and change. To
            create value with your own ideas you need to know how to code. Programming has become basic literacy for the
            21st century.</p>

        <h3>What is a program ?</h3>
        <p>We give instructions to computer to accomplish specific tasks. Such instructions are known as program
            and the act of creating a program is known as programming.

        <h3>Algorithm & its Representation</h3>
        <p>Process is basically a sequence of computations to be performed using some Logic. This is also known as an
            Algorithm. Different logic gives rise to different algorithms.</p>
        <img src="img/pic21.png" alt="">
        <p>Algorithm should be represented from our mental thoughts into a form which others can understand. There are
            primarily two ways of representing an algorithm:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Flow chart: Diagrammatic way of representing the algorithm.</li>
            <li>Pseudo-code: Representation of the algorithm in a way that is in between a program and normal English.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pseudo-code cannot be executed by a computer. It is just a representation of an algorithm for us to
            understand.

        <h3>Variables & Operators</h3>
        <p>Variables are like containers for data(i.e they hold the data) and the
            value of variable can vary in the pseudo-code
        </p>
        <p>To assign a value to the variable, we can use the = symbol. It is also called the assignment operator.It's
            called
            an operator because it operates on the data.</p>

        <h3>Decision Constructs</h3>
        <p>In a pseudo-code, typically the instructions are performed one by one or line by line. But there may be
            situations when all the statements in a pseudo-code are not performed. Parts of the pseudo-code which change
            the flow of instructions or in other word, change the flow of control are called as control structures.
        </p>
        <img src="img/pic3.png" alt="">
        <h4>Selection Constructs</h4>
        <p>if-else statements</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    if (Runway=="free") then
       display "Land"
    else if (Fuel_Status=="low") then
       display "Emergency landing"
    else
       display "Circle in the air"
    end-if
    
</pre>
        </code>
        <h4>Iteration Constructs</h4>
        <p>Sometimes, we may want to execute some statements specific (known) number of times. In such cases we can use
            a
            for loop</p>
        <p>When we want to repeatedly execute a statement as long as a condition is met, we can use the iteration
            statement
            called as while loop.</p>
        <p>Beware of infinite loops. The logic that we are writing in loops should ensure that the loop will terminate
            in
            finite number of iterations.</p>

        <h3>What is a programming language ?</h3>
        <p>To instruct the computer we need to write a program in a programming language.</p>
        <p>we will learn python which is a interpreted.Yahoo Groups,Nokia,CIA use python</p>


        <hr />
        <h3>Datatypes</h3>
        <h4>Data</h4>
        <p>We know that a program works on data or values. Some examples of values are 1, 1.0 and "Hello".</p>
        <p>For a program to use a data, it must be stored in a memory location. The values are stored in binary form in
            computer memory.</p>
        <p>How do we know how many bits are required to represent a value or how much space it needs in memory?</p>
        <p>This is determined by the data type of the value and the programming language. e.g. number, string etc. Thus
            every value will have a type.</p>
        <h4>Datatype</h4>
        <p>Data Type determines the operations that can be performed on a value. For e.g. we can perform operations like
            addition, multiplication, division, subtraction etc. on numerical data types. We can concatenate, convert
            case,
            extract substring etc. on string data types.</p>

        <p>A program may have data belonging to different types. Common data types used in programming are: </p>

        <p>In Python, the data type of a value can be identified by using type(value).</p>

        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>A variable is a name that is assigned to a value. It is done so that we can refer to that value at some later
            point in the program.</p>
        <p>Let us see the usage of values and variables in a program.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>During input, we receive values and assign them to variables.</li>
            <li>During processing, we perform operations on values and variables to generate more values. These computed
                values are also assigned to variables.</li>
            <li>During output, we display the computed values in variables to the end users.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    num=100 
    msg="Hello"
</pre>
        </code>
        <h4>Static and dynamic typing</h4>
        <p>Languages like Python are dynamically typed whereas C,Go etc are statically typed.</p>
        <p>Dynamic Typing is a technique in some languages where depending on how a value is used, the data type of the
            variable is dynamically and automatically assigned.</p>
        <p>Static Typing is used in some languages where the data type has to be declared before a variable is used</p>
        <h4>Reserved words</h4>
        <p>Any name can be given to a variable however, we cannot use some of the built-in keywords of the language.
            These
            keywords are known as reserved words.</p>
        <h4>Storing data</h4>
        <p>If you put a small product in a big box, you may end up wasting space. Similarly if you put a big product in
            a
            small box you may end up damaging the product.</p>
        <p>Just like product is placed in a box, data occupies memory. Some data need more memory whereas some other
            data
            require less memory based on the data type.</p>
        <p>In Python language, automatically creates just the right memory needed - neither less nor more.</p>
        <h4>Variable and its dimensions</h4>
        <p>We have seen that a variable will have a name, value, type and it will occupy memory. Apart from these, it
            has
            two more dimensions - scope and lifetime. Thus we can say that any variable will have the following six
            dimensions.</p>

        <h4>True or False</h4>
        <p>The result of a relational or logical expression is always a boolean (true or false). Apart from the boolean
            values, other values can also be used to represent a true or false value.
            For example, in python, value zero is considered to be equivalent to false.
            The common false values in Python are given below. Any other value is considered to be true.</p>

        <h4>Precedence of operators</h4>

        <p>Result of an expression is computed based on the precedence of the operators. Precedence of an operator can
            be
            identified based on the rule - BODMAS. Brackets followed by Orders (Powers, Roots), followed by modulo,
            Division
            and Multiplication, followed by Addition and Subtraction.
        </p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    5+4*9%(3+1)/6-1
    O/P:
    4
</pre>
                </code>
        <ul>
            <li>Brackets have the highest precedence followed by orders.</li>
            <li>Modulo, Division and Multiplication have the same precedence. Hence if all appear in an expression, they
                are
                evaluated from Left to Right. </li>
            <li>Addition and Subtraction have the same precedence. Hence if both appear in an expression, they are
                evaluated
                from Left to Right.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> prefer to have brackets as it makes the expression readable and brings in a lot more clarity.</p>

        <h3>Implicit & Explicit Type Conversion</h3>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    num=1 + 1.0
    The result is 2.0 !
</pre>
                    </code>
        <p>Here we were actually expecting the output as 2 but Python automatically converted 1 into a float and added
            with
            1.0. This is known as implicit conversion.</p>


        <p>If we want the output as 2, then we have to explicitly convert the float 1.0 into integer 1. This is known as
            explicit conversion. Explicit conversion involves mentioning the data type within brackets explicitly.</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    num=1 + int(1.0)
    The result will be 2 !
</pre>
                        </code>
        <p>Programming languages define their own rule for implicit and explicit conversions and these rules will change
            from language to language.</p>
        <p>We noticed that implicit conversions are dangerous as one may encounter unexpected result.
            Similarly, one has to be careful in explicit conversions as well. For example,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Converting a floating point value to integer would result in loss of decimal point values.</li>
            <li>A larger data type if converted to smaller data type will result in loss of data as the number will be
                truncated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Coding Standards</h3>
        <p>As per Google style guide , variable names in Python should be written as var_name.The pattern followed in
            Python
            is known as snake_case</p>
        <p>Apart from this, it is important to place comments wherever possible to explain code and use meaningful
            variable
            names. Comment is an explanation provided in the code which makes it easier to understand for a person who
            is
            going through the code.</p>
        <p>These are all part of coding standards which is a set of guidelines that can be used to enhance the
            readability
            and clarity of the program.It also makes it easier to debug and maintain the program.</p>

        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>A function is a block of code that performs a particular task. In python, functions are declared using the
            keyword def.</p>
        <p>Note:All the statements in the block of code must have the same level of indentation</p>
        <img src="img/pic5.png" alt="">
        <p>Let's see how we can use return in different ways in a function.</p>

        <h3>Control Structures</h3>
        <p>The different control structures using which the programmer specifies the order of execution of statements.
            The
            commonly used control structures in programming are:</p>
        <img src="img/pic6.png" alt="">

        <h4>Selection Control Structures</h4>
        <p>if-else, else if ladder, nested if</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    ticket_status="Confirmed"
    luggage_weight=32
    weight_limit=30  #Weight limit for the airline
    extra_luggage_charge=0
    if(ticket_status=="Confirmed"):
        if(luggage_weight>0 and luggage_weight<=weight_limit):
            print("Check-in cleared")
        elif(luggage_weight<=(weight_limit+10)):
            extra_luggage_charge=300*(luggage_weight-weight_limit)
        else:
            extra_luggage_charge=500*(luggage_weight-weight_limit)
        if(extra_luggage_charge>0):
            print("Extra luggage charge is Rs.", extra_luggage_charge)
            print("Please make the payment to clear check-in")
    else:
        print("Sorry, ticket is not confirmed")    
</pre>
    </code>
        <p>In else if ladder . The conditions are evaluated from top of the ladder downwards. As soon as a true
            condition
            is encountered, the statement associated with it is executed. The remaining condition checks in the ladder
            will be skipped.</p>
        <p>In nested if statement. In this case, an if statement is written within another if statement. Similarly, any
            decision logic can also be written within an else statement.</p>
        <h4>Iteration Control Structures</h4>
        <p>for,while</p>
        <p>In Python, for loop allows the loop to run over a specific sequence of values. In other words, for every
            value in
            the sequence, the loop runs once.</p>
        <img src="img/pic24.png" alt="">
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    print("Flight has landed")
    print("Proceed for immigration check")
    for passenger_count in 1,2,3,4,5:
        print("Immigration check done for passenger,", passenger_count)
</pre>
    </code>
        <p>'for' with range</p>
        <p>We can create a sequence of values in Python using range(x,y,step). It creates a sequence from x to y-1 with
            a
            difference of step between each value. </p>
        <p>It is not mandatory to give step. The default value of step is 1.</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    start=1
    end=10
    step=2
    for number in range (start, end, step):
        print("The current number is ", number)  
    

    for number in range(1,5):
        print ("The current number is ",number)
    
    for number in range(1,7,2):
        print ("The current number is ",number)
    
    for number in range(5,0,-1):
        print ("The current number is ",number)
</pre>
    </code>

        <p>When we want to repeatedly execute a statement as long as a condition is met, we can use the iteration
            statement
            called as while loop.</p>
        <img src="img/pic23.png" alt="">
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    baggage_count=100
    no_of_baggage_picked=0

        no_of_baggage_picked = (int)(input ("Number of baggage:"))
        baggage_count = baggage_count - no_of_baggage_picked
    print("No. of baggage remaining:",baggage_count)

        <h3>Collections</h3>
        <p>We can use collections, where data can be stored together. There are many collection data types which are
            supported by programming languages.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>List</h3>
        <p>Let's start by exploring one of the most common collection data type - list. It can be used to store a group
            of
            elements together in a sequence.</p>
        <p>Suppose we want to store the ticket numbers allocated to each passenger traveling in a flight. Instead of
            using
            separate variable for each ticket number, we can use a list as shown below.</p>
        <img src="img/pic7.png" alt="">
        <h4>storage of elements</h4>
        <p>In case of having different variables for each ticket number, variables will be stored in separate memory
            locations. Whereas in case of list, the elements will be stored in contiguous memory locations.</p>
        <img src="img/pic8.png" alt="">
        <h4>List-Index</h4>
        <p>Each element in the list has a position in the list known as an index.
            The list index starts from zero.</p>
        <img src="img/pic9.png" alt="">
        <p> index positions actually help us to directly access a value from the list. </p>
        <p> list_name[index] can be used to directly access the list element at the mentioned index position.</p>
        <p>we can also use it to directly modify an element in the list.eg:ticket_list[3]=13504.</p>
        <p>Just like how we cannot allocate 101st seat to a passenger in a 100 seat plane, we cannot access values
            beyond
            the total number of elements in the list.
            For example: print(ticket_list[5]) will result in index out of bound error. </p>

        <p>If we just want to find out whether an element is there in a list, we need not iterate through the list.
            Instead
            we can check using if..in syntax.</p>
        <code>

        <h3>Tuple</h3>

        <p>Welcome Drink, Veg Starter, Non-Veg Starter, Veg Main Course, Non-Veg Main Course, Dessert</p>
        <p>How can we store it such that no one can modify the elements?</p>
        <p>Of course, we can use a list but anybody can modify an element in the list. This is where we can use another
            collection data type known as tuple.</p>
        <p>Like list, tuple can also store a sequence of elements but the value of the elements cannot be changed. (i.e.
            tuples are IMMUTABLE). Elements can be homogeneous or heterogeneous but they are READ-ONLY.</p>

        <h3>String</h3>
        <p>In a program, not all values will be numerical. We will also have alphabetical or alpha numerical values.
            Such

        <p>Each value in a string is called a character. Just like list elements, we can access the characters in a
            string
            based on its index position.</p>

        <h3>Argument Behavior</h3>
        <p>In programming, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to functions: pass by value and pass by
            reference.</p>
        <p>Some languages use pass by value by default while others use pass by reference. Some languages support both
            and
            allow you to choose.</p>
        <p>Everything in Python is considered to be an object and can be categorized as either 'Mutable' or 'Immutable'.
            In
            Python, arguments are passed by reference.</p>
        <p>In python:</p>
        <p>Pass by reference - Immutable Objects</p>
        <img src="img/pic11.png" alt="" class="float-left">
        <img src="img/pic10.png" alt="">
        <p>Pass by reference - Mutable Objects</p>
        <img src="img/pic13.png" alt="" class="float-left">
        <img src="img/pic12.png" alt="">
        <p>In Python, when an argument passed to a function is modified inside it, whether the change is visible outside
            or
            not depends on whether the variable is mutable or not.</p>

        <hr />
        <h3>Types of Arguments:</h3>
        <p>Programming languages allow controlling the ordering and default values of arguments.
            In python we will observe the following:</p>

        <h3>Types of Variables:</h3>
        <p>There are two types of variables which we can use in a program - local variables and global variables.</p>
        <img src="img/pic15.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Local variables are the ones which are created inside a function. They are created when the owning function
            starts execution and remains in memory till owning function finishes execution. They can be accessed only
            inside
            that function.</p>
        <p>Global variables are the ones which are created outside the functions. They are created when the program
            execution starts and remains in memory till the program terminates. They can be read anywhere in the program
            -
            within a function or outside.</p>
        <h4>Variable & its scope</h4>
        <img src="img/pic16.png" alt="">
        <p>extra_baggage and extra_baggage_charge are created inside the function baggage_check(). Hence they are local
            to
            that function or in other words, they are local variables. They are created when owning function starts
            execution and remains in memory till owning function finishes execution. They can be accessed only inside
            that
            function.</p>
        <p>wt_limit is created outside the functions. Hence it is a global variable. Global variables are created when
            the
            program execution starts and remains in memory till the program terminates. They can be read anywhere in the
            program - within a function or outside. But they are protected from modification inside a function. As it is
            available throughout the program, use of global variable should be restricted to avoid accidental misuse by
            developers and to minimize memory usage.</p>
        <p>In cases where a global variable needs to be modified inside a function, like in function
            update_baggage_limit(),
            Python allows you to do that using the global keyword.</p>

        <h3>Exception Handling:</h3>
        <p>In python we can create a try and except block of code.</p>
        <p>If any error occurs in the try block of code, it will jump to except block of code.
            Once the except block is executed, the code continues to execute other statements outside except block.

        <p>Python also allows us to handle different errors that can occur separately. That means you can have a
            different
            action or message for every unique error that occurs.</p>
        <p>Here is the same expenditure calculation code with additional average expenditure calculation.</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
def calculate_expenditure(list_of_expenditure):
    total=0
    try:
        for expenditure in list_of_expenditure:

        <p>Note:</p>

            <li>Default except block is the one without any type mentioned.</li>

                not

        <h4>Multiple Try Blocks</h4>
        <p>If an error occurs inside a function and if the error is not caught inside it, then the error is transferred
            to
            the function call where we have another opportunity to catch it. </p>

        <h4>Finally Block:</h4>
        <p>Sometimes in programming we need to execute some code irrespective of whether the primary program logic
            itself
            succeeds or fails to do its job. In Python we can achieve this using a finally block. </p>
        <p>A finally block of statement is an optional part of the try-except statements. A code written inside the
            finally
            block will ALWAYS be executed.</p>

        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    balance=1000
    amount="300Rs"
    def take_card():
        print("Take the card out of ATM")

        if balance>=int(amount):
            print("Withdraw")
        else:

        <h3>Recursive Functions:</h3>
        <p>Suppose we want to find the total weight of a human tower which has 5 people standing at the bottom level.
            Assume
            that each person weighs 50 kg and there will always be odd number of men at the base level. We can solve
            this
            problem recursively. Have a look.</p>
        <p>It can have any number of levels. Each level will have 2 men less than the previous level.</p>
        <img src="img/pic18.png" alt="">
        <p>In recursion, two things are important - termination condition and recursive call. Recursive call invokes
            itself
            with a smaller argument and termination condition helps to terminate the recursive calls.</p>
        <img src="img/pic19.png" alt="">
        <p>The termination condition of a recursive function if wrong, then it will end up calling itself infinitely and
            the
            program may not stop or it may throw an error.</p>


        <hr />
        <h3>Modules & Packages</h3>
        <p>Code organization is done through modules and packages!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A module is nothing but a normal python file with a .py extension.</li>
            <li>A package is just a normal folder which contains an empty file who's name is __init__.py. Since package
                is a
                folder it can store many python modules/files in it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Python project structure</p>
        <img src="img/pic20.png" alt="">

        <h4>Importing packages</h4>
        <p>Let's assume that the ManageFlights.py inside Flights package has the below code:</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    airline="Smart Airlines"
    def add(no_of_flights):
        print(no_of_flights," flights added to the fleet")
</pre>
</code>
        <p>If we need to access the function add(), inside the ManageFlights module in some other module, then we can
            import
            the ManageFlights module and use it.</p>
        <p>Import can be done in two ways:</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    Method 1:
    from Flights import ManageFlights #from packagename import modulename
    ManageFlights.add(10)
</pre>
</code>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    Method 2:
    import Flights.ManageFlights #import packagename.modulename
    Flights.ManageFlights.add(10)
</pre>
</code>
        <h4>Packages - Naming conflicts</h4>
        <p>Consider a scenario where 2 modules have the same name but in different package and both of them have the
            same
            function 'add'.</p>
        <p>Flights->Manage.py->add()</p>
        <p>Employees->Manage.py->add()</p>
        <p>To avoid naming conflicts during import we can use one of the below techniques:</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
method1:
import Flights.Manage
import Employees.Manage
Flights.Manage.add()
Employees.Manage.add()

method2:
from Flights import Manage as FManage
from Employees import Manage as EManage
FManage.add()
EManage.add()

method3:
from Flights.Manage import add as add1
from Employees.Manage import add as add2
add1()
add2()
</pre>
</code>
        <h4>File Handling:</h4>
        <p>Python allows to create files, read from files, write content to file and append content to existing content
            through inbuilt functions!</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Method</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>open(file_path,operation)</td>
                    <td>This method is used to open the file for the specified operation. The operation can either be
                        r,w,a
                        for read, write and append.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>close()</td>
                    <td>This method is used to close a file which is already open.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>write()</td>
                    <td>This method is used to write a string to a file, if file is present. If not, it creates the file
                        and
                        writes the string into it.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>read()</td>
                    <td>This method is used to read all the contents of a file into a string.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The number of files that can be simultaneously opened by a program is limited. So it is very important to
            close
            all the files, once the operations are completed.</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    flight_file=open("flight.txt","w")
    flight_file.write("Hello")
    flight_file.close()
</pre>
</code>
        <h4>Exceptions related to file handling</h4>
        <p>Sometimes, we may encounter exceptions when dealing with files.
            In this example, we are trying to write to a file which is opened in read-only mode. This will result in an
            exception.
            In such a case, let's see how we can use try except block to catch this exception.</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
 try:
    flight_file=open("flight.txt","r")
    text=flight_file.read()
    print(text)
    flight_file.write(",Good Morning")#Exception occurs in this line
    flight_file.close()#This line will not be executed
except:
    print("Error occurred")
    if flight_file.closed:
        print("File is closed")
    else:
        print("File is open")
</pre>
</code>
        <p>When we want to write a code that will run in all situations, we can put it in a finally block.
            Since closing a file is necessary we can do it in the finally block instead of in the try block.</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
try:
    flight_file=open("flight.txt","r")
    text=flight_file.read()
    print(text)
    flight_file.write(",Good Morning")
except:
    print("Error occurred")
finally:
    print("File is being closed")
    flight_file.close()
    if flight_file.closed:
        print("File is closed")
    else:
        print("File is open")
</pre>
</code>

<h3>Advanced</h3>
<h4>Anonymous fuctions:</h4>
<p>An anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name. </p>
<p>While normal functions are defined using the def keyword in Python, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword. Hence, anonymous functions are sometimes also referred to as lambda functions, and they are often used interchangeably.</p>
<p>You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.</p>
<code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    Syntax:

    lambda arguments: expression
</pre>
</code>
<p>The main advantage of using the lambda function is executing a lambda function that evaluates its expression and then automatically returns its result. So there’s always an implicit return statement. That’s why some people refer to lambdas as single expression functions. </p>
<code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    code with def function:

    def squares(num):
    square = num * num 
    # You can also write square = num ** 2
    return square

<h4>filter</h4>
<p>The filter() function, as the name suggests, will create a new list and store only the elements that satisfy a particular condition and will filter out the remaining values.</p>
<p>The filter() operation takes a function object and an iterable and creates a new list. A successful computation is performed whenever the condition is satisfied and returns true.</p>

<h4>map</h4>
<p>map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)</p>
<p>The map() function iterates through all items in the given iterable and executes the function we passed as an argument on each of them. This is similar to the filter() function.</p>
<p>It can be used to obtain Boolean values of true and false on the conditional list or just map each element to its respective output.</p>

<p>Each of the elements in the list is mapped with their respective computed outputs(i.e squares).</p>

<h4>reduce:</h4>
<p>Unlike the previous two functions, namely filter() and map(), the reduce function works slightly different. It goes through the list of iterable numbers and proceeds to return only a single value.</p>
<p>This function can be useful in performing calculations like addition or multiplication of a list with a simple code rather than a longer code block.</p>
<code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    Print the product of all the elements in the list.

    def prod(a):
    product = 1
    for i in a:
        product = product*i
    return product

    a = [1,2,3,4,5]
    prod(a)
    OP:
    120
</pre>
</code>
<code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    from functools import reduce

    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    product = reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, a)
    print(product)
    OP:

<h4>List comprehensions:</h4>
<p>List comprehensions offer a succinct way to create lists based on existing lists. When using list comprehensions, lists can be built by leveraging any iterable, including strings and tuples.</p>
<code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    syntax:

    newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
</pre>
</code>
<p>The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.</p>
<p>The condition is optional and can be omitted:</p>
<p>The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
<p>The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list:</p>
<p>You can set the outcome to whatever you like</p>
<p>The expression can also contain conditions, not like a filter, but as a way to manipulate the outcome:</p>
<code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
    newlist = [x for x in fruits]
    print(newlist)
    OP:
    ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'mango']

    newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
    print(newlist)
    OP:
    ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']

    newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]
    OP:
    ['banana', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'mango']

    newlist = [x for x in range(10)]
    OP:
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits]
    OP:
    ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY', 'KIWI', 'MANGO']

    newlist = [x if x != "banana" else "orange" for x in fruits]
    OP:
    ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'mango']
</pre>
</code>
<p>You can also replicate nested if statements with a list comprehension:</p>
<code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    number_list = [x for x in range(100) if x % 3 == 0 if x % 5 == 0]
    print(number_list)
    OP:
    [0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90]
</pre>
</code>
<p>Here, the list comprehension will first check to see if the number x is divisible by 3, and then check to see if x is divisible by 5. If x satisfies both requirements it will print, and the output is:
</p>
<p>Nested Loops in a List Comprehension</p>
<code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    my_list = []

    for x in [20, 40, 60]:
        for y in [2, 4, 6]:
            my_list.append(x * y)
    
    print(my_list)
    OP:
    [40, 80, 120, 80, 160, 240, 120, 240, 360]
</pre>
</code>
<p>beginning with the x * y operation. This will be followed by the outer for loop, then the inner for loop.</p>
<code>
<pre class="code-fullwidth">
    my_list = [x * y for x in [20, 40, 60] for y in [2, 4, 6]]
    print(my_list)
    OP:
    [40, 80, 120, 80, 160, 240, 120, 240, 360]
</pre>
